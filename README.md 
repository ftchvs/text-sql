By leveraging advanced language models from OpenAI and Anthropic, SQL Sorcer empowers users to generate accurate SQL statements from plain English descriptions, making database interactions more intuitive and accessible.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 AI-Powered Conversion: Transform natural language queries into precise SQL statements
- 🔄 Dual API Support: Choose between OpenAI's GPT and Anthropic's Claude for diverse AI capabilities
- 📊 Multi-Table Support: Handle complex database schemas with multiple tables and relationships
- 🔧 Dynamic Schema Input: Easily input and modify your database structure through the user interface
- 💻 User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive web-based UI for seamless interaction
- 🔒 Secure Backend: Node.js server ensuring safe handling of API requests and responses
- 📚 Educational Tool: Learn SQL through natural language interactions

## 🎯 Use Cases

- 📊 Data Analysis: Quickly generate SQL queries for data exploration and reporting
- 🎓 SQL Learning: Help students understand how natural language translates to SQL
- 💼 Business Intelligence: Enable non-technical users to query databases using familiar language
- 🧪 Prototyping: Rapidly prototype database queries for application development
- 🔍 Database Exploration: Easily explore and understand new or complex database schemas

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.0.0 or higher)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)
- An API key for OpenAI GPT and/or Anthropic Claude

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ftchvs/sql-sorcer.git
   cd sql-sorcer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
   ```

## 🖥️ Usage

1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Using the interface:
   - Choose your preferred AI model (OpenAI or Claude)
   - Input your database schema (tables and columns)
   - Enter your query in natural language
   - Click "Generate SQL" to receive the corresponding SQL statement

## 🔧 How It Works

SQL Sorcer operates through a seamless process:

1. **User Input**: The user provides the database schema and a natural language query through the web interface.

2. **AI Processing**: The selected AI model (OpenAI or Claude) receives the schema and query, processing them to understand the user's intent.

3. **SQL Generation**: The AI generates a SQL statement that matches the user's request and the given database structure.

4. **Result Display**: The generated SQL is returned to the user, ready for use or further refinement.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Fine-tune SQL Sorcer by adjusting these parameters in `server.js`:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server runs (default: 3000)
- AI model settings: Modify `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and other parameters to refine AI output
